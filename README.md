# ðŸ”‹ Micro Gas Turbine Electrical Energy Prediction

This project explores time series modeling and machine learning techniques to **predict electrical energy output** from a micro gas turbine system using input variables like voltage and time. It includes exploratory data analysis, classical ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), and deep learning models (LSTM, ANN, MLP) along with Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP.

- Build **regression models** to predict electrical energy output (`el_power`).
- Apply **deep learning models** (LSTM, ANN, MLP).
- Perform **anomaly detection** and **stationarity testing**.
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance.
- Use **SHAP** for model explainability (XAI).
